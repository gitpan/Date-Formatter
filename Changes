Revision history for Perl extension Date-Formatter.

0.03  Tues April 14, 2004
    - The first test was failing, it was not due to an error
	  in the module, but instead an error in the tests. I was
	  calculating the number of hours till a certain time, so
	  I would maniplate certain blocks of code and test them. 
	  My test calculations were flawed, so it was not correctly 
	  setting the hours for the test.

    - the documentation was a little wonky, so I cleaned it up
	  nothing much else was changed though.
